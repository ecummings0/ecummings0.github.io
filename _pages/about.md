[Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://ecummings0.github.io/files/Cummings_CV_2024_v1.pdf)

I'm a PhD candidate working under Nicole Seiberlich in the Michigan Institute of Imaging Technology and Translation (MIITT) at the University of Michigan. My research interests include pulse sequence design and image reconstruction for MRI, specifically with applications in MR Fingerprinting and low-field imaging.
